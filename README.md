- **Segment Selection** - Click and drag functionality to analyze specific portions of runs with calculated averages
- **RecentRuns Component** - List view of recent running sessions with distance, pace, time, and placeholder for route maps
- **Header Component** - Simple branded header with gradient styling
- **Mock Data Integration** - Sample running data (40-minute run with pace/HR variations) for development and demo

## Features

- üìä Interactive run analysis with pace and heart rate visualization
- üéØ Segment analysis for detailed performance insights
- üì± Responsive design for all devices
- üìà Real-time statistics overview

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Styled Components for component-based CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts for interactive data visualization

## Current State

Currently uses mock/sample data for a 40-minute run showing:
- Walking phase (12.0 min/km pace, 90-95 bpm)
- Running segments (6.5-8.0 min/km pace, 135-185 bpm)
- Various pace and heart rate transitions throughout the workout

Perfect for development, testing chart interactions, and demonstrating the dashboard capabilities.
